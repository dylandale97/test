Beelife Detection Model documentation
====================================================

**Beelife** is an organisation that places beehives at businesses in
order to create more awareness for the importance of bees. These beehives
are beneficial for the food chain and diversity of plants and flowers in
the surrounding area.

To create more interaction with the beehive, a bee monitoring dashboard is
being developed. This dashboard consist of three components:

    - React Frontend
    - Laravel Backend
    - Python Detection Model

This documentation describes the ``React Frontend``. Nog toevoegen
